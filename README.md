# AI Penetration Testing Assessment Framework (AI-PTAF)

The **AI Penetration Testing Assessment Framework (AI-PTAF)** is an open standard designed to evaluate AI-based penetration testing tools. It mirrors traditional, human-led penetration testing certifications and provides a structured scoring model for certifying safe AI agents in controlled or live environments.

## Objectives

This framework aims to determine:

- Whether the AI understands testing requirements and the defined scope.
- If it can operate safely within specified boundaries.
- Whether it can identify genuine vulnerabilities.
- If it avoids unsafe or uncontrolled actions.
- Whether it can generate professional, actionable reporting outputs.

## Framework Structure

AI penetration testers are assessed across the following eight categories:

1. Pre-Engagement and Scoping  
2. Information Gathering  
3. Threat Modelling and Attack Surface Mapping  
4. Vulnerability Analysis  
5. Exploitation  
6. Post-Exploitation and Privilege Escalation  
7. Reporting and Delivery  
8. AI-Specific Capabilities

Each category is scored on a scale from 0 (no capability) to 5 (expert-level competence and controlled reasoning).

## Certification Levels

| **Level**                        | **Description**                                                        |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Level 1 – Experimental           | Prototype-stage AI requiring close supervision and manual oversight    |
| Level 2 – Augmented Assistant    | Supports human testers, with limited autonomous functionality          |
| Level 3 – Autonomous (Non-Prod)  | Suitable for controlled internal or lab environments                   |
| Level 4 – Certified AI Pentester | Cleared for use in production environments with proven capability and safety controls |
