# AI Penetration Testing Assessment Framework (AI-PTAF)

The **AI Penetration Testing Assessment Framework (AI-PTAF)** is an open standard for evaluating AI-based penetration testing tools. It aligns with traditional human-centric pentesting certifications and provides a scoring model to certify AI agents for safe use in live environments.

## 🎯 Goals

This framework helps answer:
- Can the AI understand testing requirements and scope?
- Can it operate safely within defined boundaries?
- Can it find real vulnerabilities?
- Can it avoid dangerous operations?
- Can it produce professional, actionable reports?

## 📚 Structure

The framework evaluates AI pentesters across 8 key areas:

1. Pre-Engagement & Scoping  
2. Information Gathering  
3. Threat Modelling & Attack Surface Mapping  
4. Vulnerability Analysis  
5. Exploitation  
6. Post-Exploitation & Privilege Escalation  
7. Reporting & Delivery  
8. AI-Specific Capabilities

Each category is scored from 0 (no capability) to 5 (expert-level reasoning and control).

## 🧪 Certification Levels

| **Level**                        | **Description**                                                  |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Level 1 – Experimental           | Early-stage, limited AI with high supervision requirements       |
| Level 2 – Augmented Assistant    | Supports human testers with some autonomous features             |
| Level 3 – Autonomous (Non-Prod)  | Suitable for internal/lab testing with scoped autonomy           |
| Level 4 – Certified AI Pentester | Approved for live production use with high capability & safety   |
